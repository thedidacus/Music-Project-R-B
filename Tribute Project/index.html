        <h3 class="history-pgr">The history of rhythm and blues is long and ever evolving. In the 1940s rhythm and blues was a genre of music predominantly found in African American communities.
            A melting pot of jazz and blues, along with instruments like pianos, drums, saxophones, bass, trumpets, and guitars. In the late 1950s through 1960s, rhythm and
            blues more of a "soul" theme. This would be the era where words like Motown, doo-wap, and soul music would be common when regarding rhythm and blues. Many men and
            women groups would emerge from this era. The focus would be heavily emphasized on vocals and harmony. In the 1970s rhythm and blue would again adopt names like
            funk and disco. This era would have more wacky abstract sounds, along with dancing! In the 1980s rhythm and blues would get it's first modern look with the introduction
            of modern equipment. Most of the instruments and media available in the 1980s are very much around today, however more advanced, available, and intricate.
            The 1990s would experience its own explosion of rhythm and blues. Focusing on love and expression, rhyming, blues, and the best mixing of sounds that sound has to offer,
            The best lyrics have to offer, this era would lead into the 2000s and be immortalized for its revolutionary style catching the world's attention. Of course music
            and themes of each genre had its own impacts. The political climate, cultural standards, fashion trends, global events etc. But what remains is the
            origins of rhythm and blues, having a long and rich background, and ever changing.</h3>

        <h3 class="affects-pgr">instruments and vocals have been utilized to create a hormonal experience for the creator, and listeners.
            In societies music has been a constant factor in cultural functions that tend to add immersion to a situation. Music is heavily connected with humanities free will. The amount of
            genres, styles, and themes music has is endless. Appealing to all. Combining the free will and the endless capabilities music has, with relative morals and customs, music will be
            around forever and affects all of us. Music will be there to play grief for a person who has lost. To be the encouragement to keep the courageous going. To march with the marching. To
            dance with the dancing. To celebrate the celebrations. Forever a purpose, always an occasion. Rhythm and blues specifically is responsible for most of the music you hear today. The
            rich history and eras has put R&B through many phases. The past and present theme of music is heavily inspired by rhythm and blues' origins. The taste for bass! The rhythm we all
            appreciate in our favorite music is attributed to rhythm and blues.</h3>
